## Preparing files for analysis within datavyu

*note*: The use of this package requires the use of the **datavyu** software's [Ruby API](https://datavyu.org/user-guide/api.html); note that while **datavyu** has a graphical user interface, it is accompanied by a number of Ruby scripts.

#### 1. Run the following Ruby script within the datavyu software by selecting Script and then Run Script; select a directory with one or more `.opf` files:

`csv2opf.rb`

<!-- I ran this on the Empirical Analyses folder to generate a bunch of data -->

#### 2. Open the directory that the Ruby script created; a number of CSV files for each `.opf` file should now be created.

This is the directory (folder) passed to the datavyu functions below.
