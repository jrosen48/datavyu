<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of datavyu is to to  to facilitate the use of the open-source datavyu software for the analysis of qualitative audiovisual data

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrosen48/datavyu")
```

The datavyu software must also be installed; see [here](https://datavyu.org/download.html)

## Use

*note*: The use of this package requires the use of the datavyu software's [Ruby API](https://datavyu.org/user-guide/api.html); note that datavyu provides a number of Ruby scripts.

1. . Run the following Ruby script within the datavyu software; select a directory with one or more `.opf` files:

`csv2opf.rb`

2. Open the directory that the Ruby script created; a number of CSV files for each `.opf` file should now be created. 

3. These CSV files can be loaded like any others (and can be opened in Excel); within R, they can easily be a source for visualizations, like the following, which was created with the [analysis.R](analysis.R) file:

## Other packages

We note that there is another R package that provides an interface to datavyu; that package is [{datavyur}](https://github.com/iamamutt/datavyu).

At this time, we are using this package in an experimental sense, and recommend those looking for a more-developed package consider using {datavyur} instead of this package.
